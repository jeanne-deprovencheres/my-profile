                   You probably wonder who I am and what my interests are. I'm a first-year student at Léonard de Vinci's management school in Paris. I practice dance for 9 years and I really like music. I play piano during my free time and I played guitar for 5 years. I also like to do sports, I played tennis for 5 years and I'm running regularly. Travelling is also in my plans, I have already had the chance to visit Spain, Italy, England and Sri Lanka. Thanks to LE WAGON, I just learned to code !

               <h2>Dance</h2>

               <p>
                              I've been practicing dance for 9 years now, at the conservatory of Boulogne Billancourt, and I've tried different styles like modern jazz dance, zumba, or street jazz. It is really my main interest, after my studies of course !
